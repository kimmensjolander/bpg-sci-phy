== How do I authenticate? ==

The main question asked, currently, is how to authenticate with code.google.com. More specifically, the main statement is "I know how to use subversion, but I can't get my Google password to work."

The password that you need to use is not the same password that you use to access Google. Instead, it is an automatically generated password that you get from this website:

https://code.google.com/hosting/settings

Of course, you will need to be logged into your Google account to generate this password.
